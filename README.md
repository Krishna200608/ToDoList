# ToDoList

A simple ToDoList web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, and **CSS**. This project allows users to add and delete items from a list and also create custom lists by navigating to routes like `/<yourlist>`. The application uses **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) for data persistence and is deployed on **Vercel**.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Create new to-do items on your list.
- **Delete Items:** Remove items from your list.
- **Custom Lists:** Create and access custom lists by visiting `/<listName>` in your browser (e.g., `/work`).
- **MongoDB Integration:** Stores your tasks and lists in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **Responsive UI:** Simple and clean design using CSS.
